### 🎯 **Why This Guide is Useful**

This guide is part of my effort to learn and install essential tools while understanding their functionality. By documenting the process in this repository, I aim to:
  - 📝 **Summarize Instructions**: Create a single source of truth for installing and configuring tools like GDB
  - 💡 **Reinforce Learning**: Writing down the steps helps solidify my understanding of the process.
  - 🚀 **Share Knowledge**: Make it easier for others facing similar challenges to quickly follow these steps.
  - 🛠️ **Streamline Setup**: Save time by having a ready-to-use reference for future setups.

This repository is not just a toolbox, but a growing resource to track and share my development journey. 🌱


### 🛠️ Debugging Tools

#### How I Installed GDB on My Mac 🐧

Installing GDB on macOS, especially on the latest M3 chip, can be tricky due to compatibility issues. I successfully installed GDB using the following set of instructions, using the following guide [GBD](https://github.com/DevAwizard/Toolbox/blob/main/Debugging%20Tools/GDB/README.md)

This guide walks through:

- Installing Homebrew and Rosetta 2.
- Configuring a separate x86 Homebrew for compatibility.
- Code-signing GDB for macOS security requirements.
