## Installing Initial Tools

### 🛠 Step 1: Install iTerm2 (Optional but Recommended)

If you’re on macOS, I recommend using `iTerm2` as your terminal. It’s a powerful replacement for the default Terminal app with features like:
	•	Split panes for multitasking.
	•	Better colors and font customization.
	•	Built-in search and clipboard history.

 Install iTerm2:
	1.	Go to the [iTerm2 website](https://iterm2.com/index.html).
	2.	Download and install the latest version.

After installing iTerm2, you’re ready to start setting up Neovim!

### 🛠 Step 2: Install Homebrew (If You Don’t Have It)

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install software and tools from the terminal. If you don’t have it installed yet, follow these steps:

Install Homebrew:
  1.	Open your terminal (or iTerm2 if you installed it in the previous step).
  
  2.	Run the following command to install Homebrew:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

  3.	Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. After it’s done, verify that Homebrew is installed by running:

```sh
brew --version
```

If it outputs a version number, you’re good to go!

### 🛠 Step 3: Install Neovim

Neovim is the main focus here, so let’s install it first. You don’t need Vim unless you explicitly want to use both.

Install Neovim with Homebrew (macOS):

If you’ve installed Homebrew (Step 2), installing Neovim is simple:
```sh
brew install neovim
```
After the installation, verify that Neovim is installed by running:
```sh
nvim --version
```

If it outputs a version number, like the one below, you’re good to go!

```sh
NVIM v0.10.3
Build type: Release
LuaJIT 2.1.1734355927
Run "nvim -V1 -v" for more info
```

Install Vim (Optional):

If you want to try Vim alongside Neovim:
```sh
brew install vim
```
Verify the installation with:
```sh
vim --version
```
