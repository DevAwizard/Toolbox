## Installing Initial Tools

### üõ† Step 1: Install iTerm2 (Optional but Recommended)

If you‚Äôre on macOS, I recommend using `iTerm2` as your terminal. It‚Äôs a powerful replacement for the default Terminal app with features like:
- Split panes for multitasking.
- Better colors and font customization.
- Built-in search and clipboard history.

 Install iTerm2:
 1. Go to the [iTerm2 website](https://iterm2.com/index.html).
 2. Download and install the latest version.

After installing iTerm2, you‚Äôre ready to start setting up Neovim!

### üõ† Step 2: Install Homebrew (If You Don‚Äôt Have It)

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install software and tools from the terminal. If you don‚Äôt have it installed yet, follow these steps:

Install Homebrew:
1. Open your terminal (or iTerm2 if you installed it in the previous step).

2. Run the following command to install Homebrew:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. After it‚Äôs done, verify that Homebrew is installed by running:

```sh
brew --version
```

If it outputs a version number, like the one below, you‚Äôre good to go!

```sh
Homebrew 4.4.14
```
### üõ† Step 3: Install Neovim

Neovim is the main focus here, so let‚Äôs install it first. You don‚Äôt need Vim unless you explicitly want to use both.

Install Neovim with `Homebrew` (macOS):

If you‚Äôve installed Homebrew (Step 2), installing Neovim is simple:
```sh
brew install neovim
```
After the installation, verify that Neovim is installed by running:
```sh
nvim --version
```

If it outputs a version number, like the one below, you‚Äôre good to go!

```sh
NVIM v0.10.3
Build type: Release
LuaJIT 2.1.1734355927
Run "nvim -V1 -v" for more info
```

Install Vim (Optional):

If you want to try Vim alongside Neovim:
```sh
brew install vim
```
Verify the installation with:
```sh
vim --version
```


### üõ† Step 4: Install or Enable a Coding Font (Optional but Recommended)

A good coding font with ligatures and icon support enhances your Neovim experience, especially with plugins like Telescope and lualine. Follow the instructions below depending on your setup.

#### üí° Scenario 1: Fonts Are Preinstalled in iTerm2

If you‚Äôre using iTerm2, many popular coding fonts (like Nerd Fonts) are already preinstalled. You can skip manual installation and enable one of these fonts directly:

1. Open iTerm2 Preferences:
   - Press Cmd + , or go to iTerm2 > Preferences from the menu bar.

2. Navigate to Profiles:
   - In the Preferences window, click on the Profiles tab.
	- Select your active profile (e.g., Default).

3. Go to the Text Tab:
   - Click on the Text tab (üñãÔ∏è).

4. Select a Preinstalled Font:
   - Under the Font section:
      - Click the dropdown or gear icon next to the current font.
   - Choose a preinstalled font with Nerd Font support, such as:
      - MesloLGS NF (default in iTerm2, supports Nerd Fonts).
      - JetBrains Mono Nerd Font.
      - Hack Nerd Font.
5. Save and Apply:
   - Close the Preferences window. The new font will automatically apply to your terminal.

#### üí° Scenario 2: Manually Install Fonts

1. Visit the [Nerd Fonts Website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).

2. Find a font you like:
   - `JetBrains` Mono Nerd Font (popular for coding).
   - `Fira Code Nerd Font` (great with ligatures).
   - `Hack Nerd Font` (clean and simple).

3. Download the .zip file for your chosen font.

4. Extract the .zip file.

5. Double-click the .ttf files to install them on your system.

6. Setting the Font in Your Terminal
   - Open your terminal preferences (e.g., iTerm2 or Terminal).
   - Navigate to the **Profiles** or **Appearance** section.
   - Change the font to your **installed font** (e.g., ‚ÄúJetBrains Mono Nerd Font‚Äù).
Setting the Font in Your Terminal

Whether you used a preinstalled font or manually installed one, follow these steps to apply it in your terminal:
	1.	Open your terminal preferences (e.g., iTerm2 or Terminal).
	2.	Navigate to the Profiles or Appearance section.
	3.	Change the font to your installed font (e.g., JetBrains Mono Nerd Font, MesloLGS NF).
